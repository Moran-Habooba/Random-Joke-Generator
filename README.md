# Joke Generator

This project is a simple joke generator that fetches jokes from an external API and displays them on a web page. It utilizes JavaScript and the Fetch API to retrieve random jokes and update the content dynamically.

## Features

- Joke fetching: The application fetches jokes from the Joke API by making an HTTP request to the provided URL.
- Content update: The fetched joke is dynamically displayed on the web page.
- Avoidance of offensive content: The API request is made with blacklist flags to exclude NSFW, religious, political, racist, sexist, and explicit jokes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: The structure and layout of the web page are created using HTML5 markup.
- CSS3: Styling and visual enhancements are applied using CSS3.
- JavaScript: The dynamic behavior and API interaction are implemented using JavaScript.
- Fetch API: The Fetch API is used to make HTTP requests and retrieve data from the Joke API.

## Usage

1. Open the web page in a web browser.
2. Click the "Get Joke" button to fetch a random joke from the API.
3. The fetched joke will be displayed in the designated joke container area on the page.
4. Click the "Get Joke" button again to fetch a new random joke.

Have fun and enjoy the jokes!
